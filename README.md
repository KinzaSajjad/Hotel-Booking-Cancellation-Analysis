# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis Excel Project
This project provides an in-depth analysis of booking and cancellation patterns across city and resort hotels over a three-year period (2015-2017). The data was carefully cleaned to ensure accuracy and relevance for our analysis, focusing on key metrics such as cancellation trends by guest type, room preferences, and seasonal booking behavior. Using Excel's advanced data tools, we visualized these insights in a well-structured, user-friendly dashboard that can be readily utilized by hotel management to make informed decisions.

**üìà Project Overview**

Our analysis began by cleaning the data to include only the columns essential to our study, ensuring a streamlined dataset that would yield clear, actionable insights. The cleaned dataset includes the following columns:

* **hotel**
  
* **is_canceled**
  
* **arrival_date_year**
  
* **arrival_date_month**
  
* **adults**
  
* **children**
  
* **babies**

* **country**
  
* **assigned_room_type**
  
* **reservation_status**
  
* **reservation_status_date**
  
* **room_status**
  
* **guest_type**

After preparing the data, we explored various trends related to booking volume, cancellations, and guest demographics, helping uncover patterns that can support better decision-making.

**Key Metrics:**

* **Total Bookings:** 119,390
  
* **Total Cancellations:** 44,224
  
This project aims to provide hotel managers and data analysts with insights into cancellation behaviors and booking trends, paving the way for strategic adjustments in booking policies and customer engagement.

**üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques**

* **Data Cleaning:** Selected relevant columns and cleaned data to focus on the most impactful metrics for analysis.
  
* **Excel Pivot Tables:** Used to aggregate data across dimensions such as guest type, room type, month, and hotel type.
  
* **Data Visualization:** Created dynamic charts and graphs to make patterns in booking and cancellations visually accessible.
  
* **Dashboard Design:** Developed an intuitive dashboard for a holistic view of booking behaviors, ideal for presentations and quick insights.

**üìä Insights**

**1) Cancellation by Hotel Type:**

* **City Hotels** have a higher cancellation rate (33%) compared to Resort Hotels (24%), indicating potential areas for improvement in city hotel customer retention strategies.

**2) Guest Type Analysis:**

* **Couples** contribute to the highest number of cancellations, possibly due to their larger booking volume, while single travelers show lower cancellation rates.

**3) Room Type Preferences:**

* Cancellations are higher for "desired" room types, suggesting a potential mismatch in room assignment expectations or availability issues that could be addressed.

**4) Seasonal Trends:**

* Bookings and cancellations peak during the summer months, indicating a need for proactive measures to handle demand fluctuations and optimize resources during high season.
